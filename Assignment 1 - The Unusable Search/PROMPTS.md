# Prompt 1
I need to create a website using HTML that is designed to have an intentionally horrible user experience. The entire purpose of the project is to demonstrate the dues and don’ts of user experience designed by focussing on the don’ts. What are some different elements that I can include? What are some different types of websites that may be best for this project? It can be pretty small like a single page that would act as a search page for a portfolio site, or a review/comment section for a product. It’s just a small in class activity.

# Prompt 2
I’m thinking about a search page for a portfolio site. Would you be able to create HTML for me? I think it would be funny to have a bunch of letter keys on the screen, and the user has to pick up and drag these letters into a barely visible search bar. To delete letters from the search, they need to manually pick up the letter and drag it away from the search bar. Can you make this using just HTml and css? Don’t worry about making the code look messy, it’s a design class not a coat in class so it’s just a design that needs to be user not functional

# Prompt 3
I saw you were thinking about java script, which is totally fine, just make sure to provide the javascript in a seperate file, and let me know what to name each document to ensure theyre properly linked. Continue. REMINDER OF LAST QUESTION: looks horrible (great). but I cant actually drag and drop the letters. I dont need it to work as In I dont need it to actually be able to search for projects, but i want to actually be able to move the letter keys.

# Prompt 4
This is amazing. Now, i want you to add every letter. Im also curious how difficult it would be to impliment search, and how I could achive that? I have my actual portfolio site, and could export my project names from the cms and use that somehow? it would be super cool if you got a short list of search result and clicking on it would direct you to my actual website with properly designed projetct pages, but if this is too difficult, then this existing site will be sufficient. Also, keep in mind that id love to properly publish this, either somehow within my domain or to github or something. Here are my actual protfolio names and slug Name Slug Society & Values society-values TempurBox tempurbox Conta conta Cloud 9 Café cloud-9-cafe Vinka vinka CaraClip Packaging caraclip FidgiGrip fidgigrip Architect Academy architect-academy Metaphor Chair metaphor-chair Here is the structure of my project pages relative to their slug, using the "cloud 9 cafe" project as an example. make sure to refrence each of the slugs copied above as some have hyphens and others do not: https://www.mitchellpretak.com/works/cloud-9-cafe

# Prompt 5
Couple of improvments. I love that the box remembers what letters youve placed even if you pull the letter out. Lets play into this chaos. Lets make it where the box you drop letters into is smaller, and you do one letter at a time, then press done to add the letter to the word, and it automatically puts the letter back and rearranges the letter options. To add to this, we need a clear word button that will reset the current word they were typing, along with the search results. But i only want a clear search button, not a backspace letter. I want it to be as frustrating as possible. Continuing with the clear search button, we should have a start search button, that will input the created word and search across my project database. Also, for ease of use going forward, I would love to have the section where I input project names and slugs in a seperate file if possible. Now despite intentions of making a horrible site, i still want it to be usable. Lets put in a paragraph illustrating the steps needed to be taken. a little into sentance like welcome to the worst search etc... then have a step by step guide explaining how you have to put one letter at a time, hit search, then next letter, and so on. Once you have enough of a word typed out, you manually press search to search for results, then click on the links of interest.

# Prompt 6
modifying just the script.js, is there a way to have it so that the letters do not cover the buttons? like just have teh letters spawn in lower on the page?

# Prompt 7
great, now what would i need to modify to make the container a little taller? right now the letters are covering the search results, but theres not enough room to cramp them further
