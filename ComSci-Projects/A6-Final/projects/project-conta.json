The architectural style blends Brutalism and Industrial aesthetics to stand out amidst modern glass structures, while harmonizing with the surrounding warehouses and factories. The design process included site-specific planning, mid-fidelity sketches, and a final concept that integrates organic and geometric forms to fit the natural landscape.",
